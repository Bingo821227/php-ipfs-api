Dont know what ipfs is? the future of filesystems :) read [here](https://ipfs.io) for more information!

## Installation

as always, use composer!
```
$ composer require ipfs/php
```

### choosing the HTTP Adapter

If you plan to use the REST Interface of the ipfs-daemon you should choose a http-implementation. We use [php-http](http://docs.php-http.org/) for abstraction.

See [here](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/async-client-implementation) for a list of available implementations!

if you only want to speak with a local ipfs-daemon you should use the `IPFS\\Drivers\\Cli` adapter.

### Annotations

as we use Annotations you should register the `AnnotationLoader`

```php
$loader = require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationRegistry;

AnnotationRegistry::registerLoader(array($loader, "loadClass"));
```

## Drivers

we ship with different adapters for communicating with the daemon.

### CLI

if you are using an `ipfs` binary that is not available in you `$PATH` variable, provide an `ENV` var for it:

```
$ export IPFS_BINARY=/my/location/to/ipfs
```

> make sure you set `IPFS_PATH` in you `ENV` if you are not using `~/.ipfs` as location.

to use this Driver from the commandline simply provide the option:

```
$ bin/php-ipfs version --driver=IPFS\\Driver\\Cli
```

### HTTP

if you are talking to a remote daemon  provide an `ENV` var for it:

```
$ export IPFS_API=http://somehost:5001/api/v0
```

to use this Driver from the commandline simply provide the option (or leave it away since its the default):

```
$ bin/php-ipfs version --driver=IPFS\\Driver\\Http
$ bin/php-ipfs version
```

### Client

this Driver is intended for programmatically usage:

```php
$driver = $container[IPFS\Driver\Cli::class];
//$driver = $container[IPFS\Driver\Http::class];
$client = new IPFS\Driver\Client($driver);

$reponse = $client->execute((new \IPFS\Api\Basics())->version());

var_dump($response);
```

## Apis

All Api-Endpoints are autogenerated from the official [ipfs docs](https://ipfs.io/docs/api/) and are regulary checked for changes.

> To rebuild the Apis yourself, simply run `composer rebuild-api`

The following endpoints exists:
